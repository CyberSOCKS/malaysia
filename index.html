            <div>
            <p>UTP-HAX National Hacking Competition 2015 (UTP-HAX’15) is <a href="http://www.utp.edu.my/" target='blank'>Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS</a>’s own competition that acts as the preliminary round for all Malaysian teams to advance to various Regional Asia and World Hacking Competition. The UTP-HAX’15 is a multi-tier, team-based, hacking competition operating based on <a href="http://cyberlympics.org/" target='blank' >Cyberlympic Hacking Competition</a> by <a href="http://www.eccouncilfoundation.org/" target='blank' >EC-Council Foundation</a>.</p>
            <p>To beat a hacker, you need to think like one! This is exactly what this competition is all about. It is the pinnacle of the most desired hacking competition you will ever want to be in. Thus, to master the hacking technologies, you will need to become one. UTP-HAX’15 in short will make participants undertake attempts to penetrate networks and/or computer systems using the same methods and techniques a Hacker utilizes. UTP-HAX’15 will be conducted by immersing the participants in a hands-on environment where they need to hack in and use their brain to the limit.</p>
            <p>Participants need to use creative methods to win the competition. They need to scan, test, hack, defend and use creative and constructive mind to secure a system. The contest will foster creativity, teamwork, and innovation and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure. Quite simply, it is the best place to seed creativity and inundate skills for a better world beyond imagination - TRANSCENDENCE.</p>
